# KC report test

Hello developer! Welcome to your new awesome `Web` application built with the `Spiral framework`.

To set up the project, run the following commands:
```bash
composer install
```

Now you can configure the `Database`. 
To do this, open the .env file and set up the database access credentials.
```dotenv
# Database
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_DATABASE=cycle_test
DB_USERNAME=****
DB_PASSWORD=****
```

And run migrations:
```bash
php app.php cycle:migrate
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the application using the following command:
```bash
rr serve
```

## Required Reports

Create a separate endpoint for each report so it can be used as: http://localhost:8080/{end-point}

The business needs these reports to run in under 1 second:

  1. **Monthly Sales by Region** (end point: http://localhost:8080/monthly-sales-by-region)
     * Group by: year, month, region_id
     * Show: total sales amount, number of orders
     * Must work for any 12-month period
  2. **Top Categories by Store** (end point: http://localhost:8080/top-categories-by-store)
     * Group by: store_id, category_id 
     * Show: total sales amount, rank within store 
     * Filtered by: date range (any 3 months)
 
### Task Requirements

* Write the initial `SQL` queries that generate these reports (seeds)
* Explain why they might be slow
* Modify the database schema to make them fast
* Write the new, optimized queries
* Document your approach

### Constraints
* Solution must work in MySQL 8.0
* Data is updated daily in batch (no real-time requirements)
* Must handle 2x data growth

### Evaluation Criteria
* Query Performance (40%)
* Schema Design (30%)
* Code Quality (20%)
* Documentation (10%)
